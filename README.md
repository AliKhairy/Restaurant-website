# Restaurant Website
A website I made for a coursework, requiring HTML/CSS(bootstrap) and Js. 
  - The color scheme used for this is an Arabian/desert theme, considering that I’m
  building a website for an Egyptian restaurant.
  - Changed the locations and the contacts put in the footer. I believe that more
  important stuƯ related to the restaurant should be put in the navigation bar and
  anything related to terms of services and anything else should be in the footer.
  - Menu has pictures and cards with hover animations. Makes it look a lot nicer.
  - The picture behind camel’s home looked horrible in the previous
  implementation. So, I just resorted to a camel’s icon next to the name and
  shortened the camel’s home to Camel’s to make it look nicer and cleaner.
  - I believe I put just the right amount of whitespace, so it doesn't feel bloaty.
  - Map shows your location to help the user.
  - Contact form looks better and presentable taking a bigger amount of the screen
  to be readable same for Menu.
  - Instead of a giant welcome text in your face in the homepage. It explains the
  restaurant and provides more information when you scroll down. Much better.

The website is responsive for all devices as I have tested it with multiple
resolutions by resizing the window on PC. When its about phone-size it provides
a drop-down menu.
